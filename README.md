## Challenges Faced

- First major issue was learning how to properly set up the array of my questions and answers.
- Afterwards, I spent a large amount of time trying to fully understand how creating datasets worked, and how to use them properly.
- I really had to sit down and study how using parameters in functions worked. It still hasn't 100% clickd with me yet.
